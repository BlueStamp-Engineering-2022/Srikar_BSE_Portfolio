# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was assembling all the 3D-printed parts and installing the geared servo motor on the track. In order to make sure everything was stable, I used screws and washers to fasten everything together and ensure the gear wouldn't fall off the track made for it. One modification I made (after this video was filmed) was that I broke off a part of the 3D printed part so that I could easily see the gear. I did this because it made it easier to test the door lock as a whole.

For my starter project, I made a an Arduino circuit with a potentiometer as an input, and a servo motor and LED as an output. In this circuit, the direction in which the potentiometer is turned causes the servo motor to turn accordingly. Additionally, the potentiometer serves as a dial that determines the brightness of the LED.
