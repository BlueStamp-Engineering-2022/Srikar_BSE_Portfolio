# Smartphone Controlled Door Lock
For my project, I made a door lock controlled by an android phone via bluetooth. Using the app, the user can lock or unlock their door by entering a password and choosing the action they want. Additionally, there is an LCD display outside the door that shows if the door is locked or unlocked; it also gives feedback if the entered password is incorrect.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was adding the LCD display to the door lock, which shows people outside the door if the door is locked or not. The LCD display is also attached to a potentiometer that controls the contrast of the display. During this portion of my project, I had to connect each of the pins on the LCD display to various ports on the arduino and breadboard in order to complete the circuit. This part was pretty hard because the amount of wiring doubled with the addition of the display. Finally, I coded the LCD display to print "Locked", "Unlocked", and "Wrong Password" at the appropriate times. This was relatively simple as it only needed minor changes in the code.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was wiring all the seperate components together and ensure everything was functional. During this part, I connected an arduino to a breadboard, bluetooth card, and the servo motor I assembled previously. After doing this, I coded the arduino and designed a simple android app. The android app talks to the arduino using the bluetooth card and sends a string everytime a user inputs something on the app. The code running on the arduino then dissects the string to check if the password entered in the app is correct. If so, it turns the servo motor and unlocks or locks the door. If the password is incorrect, the door locks.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was assembling all the 3D-printed parts and installing the geared servo motor on the track. In order to make sure everything was stable, I used screws and washers to fasten everything together and ensure the gear wouldn't fall off the track made for it. One modification I made (after this video was filmed) was that I broke off a part of the 3D printed part so that I could easily see the gear. I did this because it made it easier to test the door lock as a whole.

# Starter Project
For my starter project, I made a an Arduino circuit with a potentiometer as an input, and a servo motor and LED as an output. In this circuit, the direction in which the potentiometer is turned causes the servo motor to turn accordingly. Additionally, the potentiometer serves as a dial that determines the brightness of the LED.
